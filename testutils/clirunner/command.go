type Cmd struct {
	// Name is the Name of the command to run.
	//
	// This is the only field that must be set to a non-zero
	// value.
	Name string

	// Args holds command line arguments, including the command as Args[0].
	// If the Args field is empty or nil, Run uses {Name}.
	Args []string

	// Env specifies the environment of the process.
	// Each entry is of the form "key=value".
	// If Env is nil, the new process uses the current process's
	// environment.
	// If Env contains duplicate environment keys, only the last
	// value in the slice for each duplicate key is used.
	// As a special case on Windows, SYSTEMROOT is always added if
	// missing and not explicitly set to the empty string.
	Env []string

	// Stdout and Stderr specify the process's standard output and error.
	//
	// If either is nil, Run connects the corresponding file descriptor
	// to the null device (os.DevNull).
	//
	// If either is an *os.File, the corresponding output from the process
	// is connected directly to that file.
	//
	// Otherwise, during the execution of the command a separate goroutine
	// reads from the process over a pipe and delivers that data to the
	// corresponding Writer. In this case, Wait does not complete until the
	// goroutine reaches EOF or encounters an error.
	//
	// If Stdout and Stderr are the same writer, and have a type that can
	// be compared with ==, at most one goroutine at a time will call Write.
	Stdout io.Writer
	Stderr io.Writer
